### High level description of project:

San Francisco 311-request resolving-time prediction.

### Aim of the project:

Development of a predictive model to determine the time of resolving a 311-call request based on various features, such as the description, location, submission time, and corresponding agency of the request.

### Data source:  
  Data is obtained from San Francisco public dataset.  
  Exemplary features include  
  Responsible Agency: 409  
  Category: 28â€¨  
  Neighborhood: 126

  Data is heterogenous.  
  Overall mean resolving-time is 33.3 days with standard deviation of 128 days.  
  Minimum resolving-time is less than 10 minutes (e.g., Noise Complain).  
  Maximum resolving-time is over 5 years (e.g., Fix a collapsed_sidewalk)

### Data analysis pipeline:  
  1. Data cleaning  
     1.1 Remove invalid and duplicated cases  
     1.2 Deal with missing data  
          a) Fill missing categorical entries with new value - 'Missing value'  
          b) Imputation of missing 'neighborhood' using K-nearest neighborhood algorithm (accuracy of 0.89)

  2. Feature engineering  
     2.1 Generation of feature 'Request topic' using NLP, K-means clustering  
     2.2 Generation of time related features, including 'Year', 'Month', 'Weekend', 'Holiday'

  3. Model development  
     3.1 Linear regression model as the baseline model  
     3.2 Aalen's additive survival models  
     3.3 Random forest regression model  
     3.4 Gradient boosting regression model  

### Model evaluation:

| Models                             | R-squared     |
| ---------------------------------- |:-------------:|
| Linear regression model            |      0.14     |
| Aalen's additive model             |      0.10     |
| Random forest regression model     |      0.55     |
| Gradient boosting regression model |      0.51     |

Exemples of important features:  
'Request topic', 'Response Agency', 'Neighborhood', 'Year'...

Analysis of 'Year' feature leads to the discover of a interesting pattern that the mean resolving-time of 311-requests started to decrease after 2010, coinciding with the incorporation of data-driven techniques into San Francisco 311 program.

### Summary  
Random forest model performs well when modeling heterogenous data compared to other linear models.

Data driven techniques contribute to the increase of work efficiency of San Francisco 311 program.
