###High level description of project:

San Francisco 311-call request resolving time prediction.

###Aim of the project:

Development of a predictive model to determine the time of resolving a 311-call request based on various features, such as the description, location, submission time, and corresponding agency of the request.

###Data source:  
  Data is obtained from San Francisco public dataset.  
  Exemplary features include  
  Responsible Agency: 409
   Category: 28 
  Neighborhood: 126

  Data is heterogenous.  
  Overall mean time of resolving requests is 33.3 days with standard deviation of 128 days.  
  Minimum time of resolving a request is less than 10 minutes (e.g., Noise Complain).  
  Maximum time of resolving a request is over 5 years (e.g., Fix a collapsed_sidewalk)

###Data analysis pipeline:  
  1. Data cleaning  
     1.1 Remove invalid and duplicated cases  
     1.2 Deal with missing data  
          a) Fill missing categorical entries with new value - 'Missing value'  
          b) Imputation of missing 'neighborhood' using K-nearest neighborhood algorithm (accuracy of 0.89)

  2. Feature engineering  
     2.1 Generation of feature 'Request topic' using NLP, K-means clustering  
     2.2 Generation of time related features, including 'Year', 'Month', 'Weekend', 'Holiday'

  3. Model development  
     3.1 Development of linear regression model as the baseline model  
     3.2 Development of Aalen's additive survival models  
     3.3 Development of random forest regression model  
     3.4 Development of gradient boosting regression model  

###Model evaluation:

| Models                             | R-squared     |
| ---------------------------------- |:-------------:|
| Linear regression model            |      0.14     |
| Aalen's additive model             |      0.10     |
| Random forest regression model     |      0.55     |
| Gradient boosting regression model |      0.51     |
                                         R2
linear regression model                 0.11
Aalen's additive model                  0.10
random forest regression model          0.55
gradient boosting regression model      0.51

Feature importance:  
'Request topic', 'Response Agency', 'Neighborhood', 'Year'

Analysis of 'Year' feature leads to the discover of a interesting pattern that the mean resolving time of 311 requests started to decrease after 2010, coinciding with the starting time of data driven techniques' incorporation into San Francisco 311 program management.

###Summary  
Random forest model performs well when modeling heterogenous data.

Data driven techniques may contribute to the increase of work efficiency of San Francisco 311 program.
